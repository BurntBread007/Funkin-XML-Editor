# Funkin XML Editor
(now made with a potato brain)

## Installation:
1. Install Python 3+ from [this](https://www.python.org/downloads/) download page. Note that no extra packages are required *for the time being*, but this may change.
2. If you're on Windows 10, install [this](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/python-39/9p7qfqmjrfp7) version instead from the Microsoft Store.

3. Install the latest release of this tool from the Releases tab on the side.

4. Run **test.py** with python and you're all set!

## Usage:
Follow the onscreen texts in the terminal. It will ask for sprite width, height, and spacing between each frame. This will then all be calculated to fit the frames proportionally onto a custom spritesheet, and then add along a .xml file with the custom sizes.

*Note: This program is only a project of mine, and I don't have much experience in any of this yet. Don't expect any neat code or fancy GUI's, only expect it to *work*. I also only plan to update it when I feel like it, which may be randomly or not at all.*

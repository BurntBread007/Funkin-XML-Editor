# FunkyXML Editor
### For use with the game 'Friday Night Funkin' as a modding tool.

## Installation:
1. There are two options for installing; a .exe, as well as the .py project.

1b. If you choose the python project, install Python 3+ from [this download page](https://www.python.org/downloads/). **Or if you're on Windows 10, install [this python version](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/python-39/9p7qfqmjrfp7) instead from the Microsoft Store.** 

Note: You need to install the Pillow python module to be able to save a spritesheet guide. However, this does not apply if you are downlading the .exe project.

2. Install the latest release of this tool from the Releases tab on the side. The exe project has "EXE" marked at the end of the zip file, with python ending with "PYTHON".

3. Run **runthis.py** with python, or **FunkyXML-Editor.exe** and you're all set!

## Usage:
Follow the onscreen texts in the terminal. It will ask for sprite width, height, and spacing between each frame. This will then all be calculated to fit the frames onto a custom spritesheet, and then add along output files (spritesheet guide and custom xml file).

**Note: This program is only a project of mine, and I don't have much experience in any of this yet. Don't expect any neat code or fancy GUI's, only expect it to *work*. I also only plan to update it when I feel like it, which may be randomly or not at all.**
